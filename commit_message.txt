feat: Enhance admin booking management with new workflow and UI improvements

This commit introduces significant enhancements to the admin dashboard's booking management features, focusing on a clearer workflow for pending bookings and improved user information display.

Key changes include:

- **Separate Pending Bookings Section:**
  - Introduced a dedicated section at the top of the Admin Dashboard for bookings awaiting confirmation.
  - Bookings with 'waiting for confirmation' status are now displayed here with "Accept" and "Decline" actions.

- **Booking Decline Functionality:**
  - Added a 'Declined' status option to the booking edit form.
  - Implemented a conditional text area in the edit modal for admins to provide a reason when declining a booking.
  - Created a new backend endpoint (`/api/admin/decline-booking`) to handle declining bookings, which:
    - Updates the booking status in Firestore to 'declined'.
    - Sends a customized email to the user with the decline reason.
    - Deletes the associated Google Calendar event.
  - Modified frontend logic to correctly pass `declineReason` and `calendarEventId` when declining.

- **Improved "All Processed Bookings" Display:**
  - The main bookings table ("All Processed Bookings") now exclusively displays bookings with 'booking confirmed' or 'declined' statuses.
  - Bookings in this list are now sorted by date and time, with upcoming bookings appearing first.
  - The "Confirm" action button has been removed from this section, as pending booking actions are handled separately.
  - User display in the table changed from `UserName (UserID)` to `UserName (Email)` for better clarity.

- **Modal Enhancements:**
  - Updated booking edit modal to be scrollable with `max-h-[90vh]` and `overflow-y-auto` to prevent content overflow on smaller screens.
  - Increased modal width from `max-w-md` to `max-w-lg` to accommodate more content.

These changes streamline the admin's ability to manage bookings, provide clearer communication to users regarding booking statuses, and enhance the overall usability of the dashboard.
